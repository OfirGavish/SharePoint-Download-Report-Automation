## üîß Technical Comparison

### PowerShell Module Requirements

**Azure Storage Approach:**
```powershell
# Uses latest stable versions - flexible and modern
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement  # Latest version
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication  # Latest version
Install-Module Az.Storage  # Latest version
```

**SharePoint Upload Approach:**
```powershell
# Requires specific versions for reliability
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 3.5.0
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -RequiredVersion 2.25.0
Install-Module ImportExcel  # Latest version
```

### Authentication Methods

**Azure Storage:**
- ‚úÖ Modern authentication patterns
- ‚úÖ Managed Identity support
- ‚úÖ Service Principal with secrets or certificates
- ‚úÖ Interactive authentication for development

**SharePoint Upload:**
- ‚úÖ Certificate-based authentication (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Azure Automation Account integration
- ‚úÖ Service Principal authentication
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Specific module version dependencies

### Deployment Complexity

**Azure Storage:**
```bash
# One-click deployment
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group rg-sharepoint-monitoring \
  --template-file deployment/azuredeploy.json
```

**SharePoint Upload:**
```powershell
# Manual Azure Automation setup required
1. Create Automation Account
2. Install specific module versions
3. Configure variables and certificates
4. Upload and schedule runbook
```
