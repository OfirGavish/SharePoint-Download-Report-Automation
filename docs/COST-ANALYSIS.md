# Azure Cost Analysis - SharePoint Download Monitoring

This document provides cost estimates for the SharePoint Download Monitoring solution to help you understand the financial impact.

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown (Monthly Estimates)

### Default Deployment (CDN Disabled) - Cost Optimized ‚úÖ

| Resource | Type | Estimated Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|----------------------|-------|
| **Storage Account** | Standard LRS | ~$2-5 | Based on data volume and requests |
| **Static Website Hosting** | Included | $0 | No additional cost |
| **Blob Storage (Data)** | Hot Tier | ~$1-3 | For JSON data files |
| **Data Transfer** | Outbound | ~$1-2 | Internal network usage |
| **Total Monthly** | | **~$4-10** | **Cost-optimized for internal use** |

### With CDN Enabled (Optional) - Higher Performance

| Resource | Type | Estimated Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|----------------------|-------|
| **Storage Account** | Standard LRS | ~$2-5 | Same as above |
| **Azure CDN Profile** | Standard Microsoft | ~$5-15 | Base cost + data transfer |
| **CDN Data Transfer** | Global | ~$10-50 | Depends on traffic volume |
| **Cache Operations** | CDN | ~$2-5 | Based on request frequency |
| **Total Monthly** | | **~$19-75** | **Higher cost for global access** |

## üìä Cost Factors

### Storage Account Usage
- **Data Storage**: Minimal cost (~$0.02/GB/month for LRS)
- **Transactions**: Low cost (~$0.0004 per 10K operations)
- **Static Website**: No additional hosting fees

### CDN Impact (When Enabled)
- **Base CDN Profile**: ~$5/month minimum
- **Data Transfer**: $0.087-0.16/GB depending on region
- **Cache Operations**: $0.0075 per 10K requests
- **SSL Certificate**: Included at no additional cost

### Regional Variations
- **US/EU**: Lower data transfer costs
- **Asia/Pacific**: Slightly higher costs
- **Multi-region**: Costs scale with usage

## üéØ Cost Optimization Strategies

### ‚úÖ Implemented Optimizations

1. **CDN Disabled by Default**
   - Saves $15-65/month for internal use cases
   - Storage account direct access is sufficient for corporate networks
   - Only enable CDN for public-facing or high-traffic scenarios

2. **Standard LRS Storage**
   - Most cost-effective replication option
   - Adequate for non-critical dashboard data
   - Upgrade to GRS only if disaster recovery is critical

3. **Hot Tier Blob Storage**
   - Optimized for frequent dashboard access
   - Better than Cool tier for interactive dashboards
   - Archive tier not suitable for real-time data

### üîß Additional Savings

4. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Archive old data after 90 days
   - Delete unnecessary log files
   - Implement data retention policies

5. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Set up cost alerts at $10, $25, $50 thresholds
   - Monitor data transfer patterns
   - Review monthly usage reports

6. **Right-Sizing Resources**
   - Start with Standard LRS
   - Monitor performance needs
   - Upgrade only when necessary

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Small Organization (< 1000 users)
- **Expected Cost**: $4-8/month
- **Data Volume**: < 1GB/month
- **Recommendation**: Default configuration without CDN

### Medium Organization (1000-5000 users)
- **Expected Cost**: $8-15/month
- **Data Volume**: 1-5GB/month
- **Recommendation**: Consider GRS for redundancy

### Large Organization (> 5000 users)
- **Expected Cost**: $15-30/month
- **Data Volume**: 5-20GB/month
- **Recommendation**: Evaluate CDN for performance

### Global Organization
- **Expected Cost**: $30-75/month
- **Data Volume**: 20GB+/month
- **Recommendation**: Enable CDN for global users

## üö® Cost Alerts Setup

Configure these alerts in Azure:

```bash
# Alert at $10 monthly spend
az monitor metrics alert create \
  --name "SP-Monitor-Cost-Alert-10" \
  --resource-group "your-rg" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/your-sub-id" \
  --condition "total-cost gt 10" \
  --description "SharePoint monitoring costs exceed $10"

# Alert at $25 monthly spend  
az monitor metrics alert create \
  --name "SP-Monitor-Cost-Alert-25" \
  --resource-group "your-rg" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/your-sub-id" \
  --condition "total-cost gt 25" \
  --description "SharePoint monitoring costs exceed $25"
```

## üîç Cost Monitoring

### Weekly Reviews

- Consider storage tier adjustments

## üí° Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Value Delivered
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Priceless for audit readiness
- **Security Insights**: Early detection of unusual access patterns
- **User Behavior Analytics**: Optimize content strategy
- **Automated Reporting**: Save hours of manual work

### ROI Calculation
- **Time Saved**: ~4-8 hours/month of manual reporting
- **Personnel Cost Savings**: $200-800/month (depending on hourly rate)
- **Solution Cost**: $4-30/month
- **ROI**: 500-2000% return on investment

## üéØ Recommendation

**For Most Organizations**: Use the default deployment (CDN disabled)
- ‚ö° Adequate performance for internal users
- üí∞ Minimized costs (~$4-10/month)
- üîß Easy to enable CDN later if needed
- üìä Full functionality maintained

**Enable CDN Only When**:
- Users are globally distributed
- External access is required
- Performance is critical
- Budget allows for additional cost
